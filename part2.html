            We're going to be copying and pasting a lot of Bash scripts. This saves a lot of time. It's also quite risky. Obfuscated Bash scripts serve as major attack vectors against otherwise security-conscious users.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today's guide will therefore help you install a tool called <code>h20-shellaudit</code>. It provides a quick and easy way to audit scripts you find, and combines classical anti-obfuscation techniques with AI assistance.

            We'll start off by installing a small anti-obfuscation utility called <code>h20-shellguard</code>. It's used in the audit process, and we might as well install it first.

            As a precautionary measure, use a tool of your choice (online or otherwise) to strip any unicode or fancy ASCII control characters from the following script. Then feed it to an LLM and discuss whether it's safe to run. If you're convinced it's okay, run it inside <code>dXX</code>.

# h20-shellguard: Basic Bash Hardening
# -------------------------------------
# This function is designed to work in tandem with 'h20-auditor',
# a separate tool that scans and normalizes shell scripts to help
# detect obfuscation, trickery, and steganographic code.
#
# ShellGuard adds runtime protections that:
# - Make unsafe patterns more likely to fail early
# - Reduce attack surface for shell abuse
#
# It does NOT provide meaningful protection, and a malicious script or user can
# reverse the changes imposed by ShellGuard. It is ONLY useful in tandem with
# auditing tools (like ShellAudit, or otherwise).
#
# By default, it must be activated manually via 'h20-shellguard'.
# But note that ShellAudit inserts its own h20-shellguard commands.
# So if you got the script from ShellAudit, you don't have to manually activate ShellGuard.
#
# There is no associated 'disable' command. To revert, close the terminal and reopen it.

            After doing this, give the following code to one or more AI chatbots that you trust. Ask the bots for a clear and simple explanation of what the code does. Emphasise that you're looking for attempts at obfuscation, unsafe behaviours, or anything tricky that might have been put there to confuse, deceive, or exploit the user. The more chatbots you ask, the better. If you can find chatbots that have been specifically trained on malicious and obfuscated code, that's even better. Once you've convinced yourself that the code is safe, copy-and-paste the code into <code>debian-XX-xfce</code>. This will install ShellAudit.

    " - Misleading command substitution: Using command substitution like $(cd tempdir && do_something) where the intent is unclear.\n"
    " - Disguised silent failures: Chaining commands with && or || in non obvious ways, or relying on failure of certain commands, to bypass critical checks or logic branches.\n"
    " - Function and subshell side effect confusion: Mixing function calls and subshells, intentionally obfuscating which operations persist and which do not, making it hard to follow control flow or detect persistent changes.\n"

            Go back to the script from earlier. The big one, that installed ShellAudit. Copy the script, and paste it into a running instance of itself. After you've pasted, press CTRL+D, and check the warnings. If you see any, STOP IMMEDIATELY; scripts I provide should not generate any warnings, period.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now use CTRL+SHIFT+C to copy to the global clipboard.
        </p>
        <p>
            Open a web browser, and navigate to your favourite chatbots again. Use CTRL+SHIFT+V followed by CTRL+V to paste in the prompt, and see what the bots say. Chat with them until you're satisfied that the code is safe. As mentioned earlier, it's better to chat with LLMs that have been trained on malicious or obfuscated code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now go back to ShellAudit, and press Enter. This will put the sanitized version of the code into the clipboard, without the LLM prompts. From now on, it's this sanitized version of the code you'll be pasting into your terminal. Do not use the originals you got from my website, or anywhere else, as they haven't been sanitized, and are thus more likely to contain malicious code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, try to resist the urge to copy the script back out of the LLM after pasting it in, since that increases the attack surface. For example, if the organization hosting the LLM turns out to be malicious, you don't want to be running code that you got back from their website.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that when ShellAudit is used with scripts from other websites, tolerating certain warnings might be OK, or not OK, depending on the nature of the warning and your risk appetite. Consider asking AI to rewrite the script to meet the (arguably excessive) ShellAudit requirements. If you don't want to do that, consider using a less opinionated auditing tool.
