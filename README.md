# Hero to Zero: A Guide To Digital Sovereignty

Welcome to the Github page for the **Hero to Zero** project! Our website is dedicated to helping everyday people lock down their digital systems, protect their privacy, and navigate the increasingly hostile digital environment.

Our goal is to educate users on how to avoid being targeted by hackers, scammers, corporate surveillance, unlawful and aggressive policing, and bad-faith prosecution.

We do not condone criminal activity of any kind. Rather, our focus is on educating ordinary people on what they can do to protect themselves and their families.

Whatever you do, be sure to do it with respect for the law, with love in your heart, and with the public interest in mind.

And remember, always:

**Privacy is Not Suspicious**

## About the Project

**Hero to Zero** is a privacy and security educational website aimed at everyday users. It provides practical, easy-to-follow advice on how to protect yourself in a world where mass-surveillance is the norm, and our privacy and safety is often put in jeopardy as a result of normal activities like browsing the web, walking to the shops, or seeing the doctor.

Our website aims to make complex privacy and security topics understandable for non-technical users, so they can take action to safeguard themselves without needing deep technical knowledge.

We cover a range of topics focused on QubesOS, GrapheneOS, OPNsense, self-hosting, anonymous access to LLMs, the benefits of paying with cash, and the importance of choosing organizations with a strong reputation for security and privacy. The appropriate use of jurisdictional barriers for ethical purposes is also a theme.

We do not condone unethical or unlawful use of technology. If you plan to use technology to harm people in exchange for personal gain, consuming the information we provide is a breach of our Terms of Service. Remember: your first line of defense against institutional overreach is, and always will be, knowing the law, understanding your rights, and adhering to the relevant normative and legal principles.

The guidance provided by Hero To Zero is offered in the spirit of love, and should only be consumed in that same spirit. It comes with absolutely no warranty of any kind.

## Stance on Criminality

Hero to Zero does not support or condone any form of criminal activity. Your first line of defense against overzealous policing and malicious prosecution is knowing the relevant standards and adhering to those standards. Ethics and community-mindedness are also important. If something that's illegal should not be illegal, we recommend contacting your local member to convey your opinions, while adhering with any and all relevant statutes and common-law principles.
